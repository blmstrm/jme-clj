A Clojure wrapper library for [jMonkeyEngine](https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine). jMonkeyEngine is a 3D
game engine for adventurous Java developers (now Clojure developers). It is open-source, cross-platform, and
cutting-edge. Please check [jMonkeyEngine Wiki](https://wiki.jmonkeyengine.org/docs/3.3/documentation.html) if you would

is [jMonkeyEngine Hub](https://hub.jmonkeyengine.org/) that you can ask/search for questions, the community is very
responsive and friendly.

The engine is used by several commercial game studios and computer-science courses. Here's a taste:
